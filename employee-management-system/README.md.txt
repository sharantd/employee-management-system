# Employee Management System

## Overview

This is a **Spring Boot** based web application that allows **Human Resources (HR)** or managers to **manage employee records**. The system supports basic **CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete)** operations on employee data and is designed to demonstrate backend development using **Java**, **Spring Boot**, and **MySQL**.

## Features

- **Add New Employee**: Allows the addition of a new employee with details like name, position, and salary.
- **View All Employees**: Displays a list of all employees stored in the system.
- **View Employee by ID**: View specific details of an employee by their ID.
- **Update Employee**: Update the information of an existing employee (name, position, salary).
- **Delete Employee**: Remove an employee from the system.
  
## Technologies Used

- **Java 11**: Programming language used for building the application.
- **Spring Boot**: A Java framework used to build the REST API.
- **Spring Data JPA**: Provides JPA-based repository support, making it easy to interact with databases.
- **MySQL**: Used as the relational database for storing employee data.
- **Maven**: For project dependency management and build automation.
- **JUnit & Mockito**: For writing unit tests and testing the application.
